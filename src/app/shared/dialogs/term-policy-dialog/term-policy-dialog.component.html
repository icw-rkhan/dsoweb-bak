After posting your Content on, through or in connection with DSODentist, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the limited license herein.

This limited license does not grant NMG the right to sell or otherwise distribute your Content outside of DSODentist or Linked Services. After you remove your Content from DSODentist, we will cease distribution as soon as practicable, and at such time when distribution ceases, the license will terminate. If after we have distributed your Content outside of DSODentist, you change the Content’s privacy setting to “private,” we will cease distribution of such “private” Content outside of DSODentist as soon as practicable after you make the change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that once Content is distributed to a Linked Service or incorporated into other aspects of DSODentist, NMG is under no obligation to delete or ask other Users or a Linked Service to delete that Content, and therefore it may continue to appear and be used indefinitely. <br><br>
    6.2 The license you grant to NMG is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to NMG), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that NMG is not required to pay you or anyone else deriving rights from you for the use on DSODentist of the Content that you post), sublicensable (so that NMG is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors, and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide DSODentist), and worldwide (because the Internet and DSODentist are global in reach). <br><br>
    6.3 You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on, through or in connection with DSODentist, or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this Section 6, and (ii) the posting of your Content on, through or in connection with DSODentist and/or Linked Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity.

You may also contact us by mail at 1000 Wyckoff Avenue, Mahwah, NJ, 07430. <br><br> Scope. This privacy policy covers all of DSODentist.

In some cases, you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it. <br><br> Access Device and Browser Information. When you access DSODentist from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit. <br><br> Cookie Information. We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make DSODentist easier to use, to improve the quality of the educational contents shared herein, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and DSODentist. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you return to DSODentist. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into DSODentist, and to know when you are interacting with our widgets and Share buttons and app advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use DSODentist. <br><br> Information from other mobile apps. We may institute programs with advertising partners and other mobile apps in which they share information with us: <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements seen by dental students and professionals.

        <li>
          We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.
        </li>
      </ul><br>
      If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we will “anonymize” it within 180 days, meaning we will stop associating the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we will only use the information in the ways we explain in the “How We Use Your Information” section below. <br><br> Information from other users. We may collect information about you from other DSODentist users, such as when a connection tags you in a photo or video, or provides details regarding a group you share. <br><br><br>

      </ul><br><br>
      4. Information You Share With Third Parties. <br> Connecting with an Application or Mobile app.  When you connect with an application or mobile app it may have access to General Information about you.  The term General Information includes you and your connections’ names, profile pictures, year of graduation, and content you shared.  We may also make information about the location of your computer or access device and your academic concentration available to applications and mobile apps in order to help them implement appropriate security measures and control the distribution of age-appropriate content.  If the application or mobile app wants to access any other data, it will have to ask for your permission. <br><br> You should always review the policies of third-party applications and mobile apps to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them. We do not guarantee that they will follow our rules. If you find an application or mobile app that violates our rules, you should report the violation to us by emailing rgroves@thenextmediagroup.com and we will take action as necessary. <br><br> Pre-Approved Third-Party Mobile Apps and Applications.  In order to provide you with useful social experiences from DSODentist, we occasionally need to provide General Information about you to pre-approved third-party mobile apps that use DSODentist at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to DSODentist). You can also block a particular pre-approved mobile app or application by clicking "No Thanks" in the user window when you visit that application or mobile app.  In addition, if you log out of DSODentist before visiting a pre-approved application or mobile app, it will not be able to access your information. <br><br> Exporting Information. You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book applications, or copy and paste functions, to capture, export (and in some cases, import) information from DSODentist, including your information and information about you. <br><br> Advertisements. Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on DSODentist use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may opt-out of the placement of cookies by using your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks. <br><br> Links. When you click on links within DSODentist you may leave our app. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements. <br><br><br>
      5. How We Use Your Information <br> Next Media Group uses the information collected through DSODentist to try to provide an educational, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that: <br><br> To manage the service. We use the information we collect to provide our educational services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and we use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users. <br><br> To contact you. We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. We may include content you see on DSODentist in the emails we send to you. <br><br> To serve personalized advertising to you. We know how important focus is on your professional development, and while you're pursuing your university degree we will not share your information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent would be if you asked us to provide your mailing address to an advertiser to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your graduation year or other such personal information or educational preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use your interest in operative dentistry to show you ads for adhesive products, but we do not tell the advertiser/manufacturer who you are. As a dental student or professional, we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, but when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected. <br><br> To supplement your profile. We may use information about you that we collect from other DSODentist users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status/group update). In such cases, we generally give you the ability to remove the content (such as allowing you to remove a photo tag of you) or limit its visibility on your profile. <br><br> To help your connections find you. We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including through contact importers and search.  You can prevent other users from using your email address to find you using the search section of your privacy settings. <br><br><br>
      6. How We Share Information <br> DSODentist facilitates the sharing of dental education content and such information with others — connections and educators in your communities — while providing you with privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing some of your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. For example: <br><br> When you invite a peer to join. When you ask us to invite a peer to join DSODentist, we will send your fellow dental peer a message on your behalf using your name.  The invitation may also contain information about other users your peers might know.   We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name. <br><br> When you choose to share your information with marketers. You may choose to share information with dental manufacturers through offers on DSODentist. This is entirely at your discretion and while you are enrolled in DSODentist as a dental student or professional we will not provide your information to such marketers without your consent. <br><br>
      When we share your information with marketers. Your contact information may only be shared with sponsors of DSODentist after you have graduated from dental school. On certain occasions, information may be shared in advance of your graduation to designated sponsors who offer job opportunities and/or special services that we believe will be of interest and benefit to you prior to graduation. The information we share will be limited to the following; your dental school, year of graduation, intended dental specialty (if any), and your contact information. <br><br> To help your peers find you. By default, we make certain information you have posted to your profile available in search results on DSODentist to help your peers find you. You can control who can see some of this information, however, as well as who can find you in these searches, through your privacy settings. <br><br> To give search engines access to publicly available information. We generally limit search engines’ access to our app. We may allow them to access information published by Next Media Group, Inc and user-generated information set to the “everyone” setting (along with your name and profile picture) and your profile information that is visible to everyone.  You can change the visibility of some of your profile information using the customizable sections of your privacy settings. <br><br> To help improve or promote our service. Sometimes we share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our service. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information. <br><br> To provide you with services. We may provide information to service providers that help us bring you the services we offer. For example, we may use third parties to help host our mobile app, send out email updates about DSODentist, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, or provide search results or links (including sponsored links). These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service. <br><br> To advertise our services. We may ask advertisers outside of DSODentist to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser. <br><br> To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities. <br><br> Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy. <br><br><br>
       
      7. How You Can Change or Remove Information <br> Editing your profile. You may change or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking “Edit My Profile.” Information will be updated immediately. <br><br> Deactivating or deleting your account. If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information (connections, photos, etc.) in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to DSODentist. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from DSODentist. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it. You may deactivate your account on your My Profile page or delete your account by emailing us accordingly at rgroves@thenextmediagroup.com. <br><br> Limitations on removal. Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. However, your name will no longer be associated with that information on DSODentist. (For example, if you post something to another user’s profile and then you delete your account, that post may remain, but be attributed to an “Anonymous DSODentist User.”)  Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third-party mobile apps access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.  But they will no longer be able to access the information through our Platform after you disconnect from them. <br><br> Backup copies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others. <br><br> Non-user contact information. If a user provides your email address to us, and you are not a user of DSODentist but you want us to delete your address, you can do so by emailing rgroves@thenextmediagroup.com. However, that request will only apply to addresses we have at the time of the request and not to any addresses that users provide to us later. <br><br><br>
      8. How We Protect Information <br> We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help. <br><br> Steps we take to keep your information secure. We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of app features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations. <br><br> Risks inherent in sharing information. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on DSODentist will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on DSODentist. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password. <br><br><br>
      9. Other Terms <br> Changes. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to improve the service of DSODentist. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. <br><br> Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States. By using DSODentist, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. <br><br> Defined Terms. "Us," "we," "our," and "DSODentist" refer to Next Media Group, Inc. and its mobile app developed for the education of dental students and professionals unless otherwise limited by the context. <br><br>
